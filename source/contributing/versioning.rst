The Sponge Versioning System and Repository Branch Layout
=========================================================

With the release for beta we've moved the sponge API versioning to semantic versioning (see http://semver.org/).
This change means that every time that we make a release we have to increment the version according to the rules
of semver. This means that a release containing changes which are not backwards-compatible must be one
*major* version ahead of the previous release. If there are only new features or binary compatible bugfixes then
the new release will be one *minor* version ahead of the previous release, and if the release strictly contains
bugfixes then only the *patch* version will be incremented.

The layout of our branches (described below) is designed to assist this process by allowing us
to make minor releases without a breaking change forcing us to make it a major release. This branch
layout applies to the SpongeAPI, SpongeCommon, SpongeForge, and SpongeVanilla repositories.

The Core Branches
=================

There are three branches which form the core of our repositories; they are ``master``, ``bleeding``, and
``release``. The ``master`` and ``bleeding`` branches are for active development and the ``release`` branch tracks
the commit as of the most recent release build.

The key differences between the ``master`` and ``bleeding`` branches is that any ``feature`` branches which are
breaking *must* be merged into the bleeding branch. This allows the ``master`` branch to only contain
backwards-compatible changes allowing minor versions to be released based on it if necessary.

Release Branches
================

Prior to releasing builds the content of the release should be first moved to a release prep branch.
This branch allows dedicated testing to be performed for a release without forcing a code freeze on
the development branches. Any bugfixes applied to the ``release`` branch are merged back to the ``master``
branch when the release is finalized. Once a release is made the version of the ``master`` and ``bleeding``
branches are both updated: the ``master`` branch to the next minor version and the ``bleeding`` branch to
the next major version (assuming it was not already on the next major version).

Hotfix Branches
===============

If after a release is made, and a significant bug is found, a ``hotfix/foo`` branch can be created based on the
last release version and a new release can be made from this hotfix branch with the patch version
incremented by one. The hotfix branch can then be merged back into ``master`` for inclusion into future
versions.

Feature Branches
================

New features or changes will continue to be done in a ``feature/foo`` or ``fix/bar`` branch. When merging
back into a development branch (``master`` or ``bleeding``) you should consider whether the changes are
breaking or are strictly backwards-compatible. If the changes are purely new features, or
binary-compatible bugfixes, then the feature branch can be merged into the ``master`` branch. If the
changes include any breaking changes however, then the feature branch must be merged into the
``bleeding`` branch to be included in the next major release.
