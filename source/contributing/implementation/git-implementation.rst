Git Workflow for API and Implementations
========================================

Developing the API
==================

The basic process of adding your changes is explained in the :doc:`../howtogit` section. On top of that we suggest that
you create your new branch with a meaningful name, preferably something like ``feature/your-feature-name-here``.

Additionally we require that you ensure the module will compile with ``gradle compileJava``.
This will run a simple build of the source files. When finished successfully, you can PR your changes to the SpongeAPI
repo.

Developing the Implementation
=============================

The process for the implementations is almost the same as for the API. You add your changes as described in :doc:`../howtogit`.
Note that you should give your branches a meaningful name, preferably ``feature/your-feature-name-here``.
Run ``gradle compileJava`` to check if everything compiles without errors.

Since you are working on the implementation, there is a possibility that your work included changes in the API. This is
okay. Just remember to ensure the pointers for the version of the SpongeAPI match the version of your branch prior to
committing and pushing. To do this, you may need to add the submodules to the commit (with ``git add SpongeAPI`` and/or
``git add Mixin``) prior to committing on your implementation work.

You may open a pull request once your commit is pushed to your fork or the repository.
